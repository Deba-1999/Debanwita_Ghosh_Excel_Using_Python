Python is considered a more efficient data analysis tool for complex calculations and large volumes of data. However, Excel is still more popular overall than Python, and it is used by a large number of people in financial analysis. While Excel is not ideal for handling large volumes of data, it is a more convenient tool for organizations with small volumes of data that require simple calculations. Python, on the other hand, is more efficient than Excel when the organization handles large volumes of data that require automation to produce results within a short period. For this reason, we use Python for excel function.
